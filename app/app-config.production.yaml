backend:
  # Note that the baseUrl should be the URL that the browser and other clients
  # should use when communicating with the backend, i.e. it needs to be
  # reachable not just from within the backend host, but from all of your
  # callers. When its value is "http://localhost:7007", it's strictly private
  # and can't be reached by others.
  baseUrl: https://developer.polarpoint.io
  listen:
    port: 7007
    # The following host directive binds to all IPv4 interfaces when its value
    # is "0.0.0.0". This is the most permissive setting. The right value depends
    # on your specific deployment. If you remove the host line entirely, the
    # backend will bind on the interface that corresponds to the backend.baseUrl
    # hostname.
    host: 0.0.0.0
